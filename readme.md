# We would like you to build a NodeJS application using the Express framework for the frontend team to build the UI. 
# The data needed for the table in the screen is to be sent from a NodeJS backend that uses MongoDB.
# The API endpoints could be using GET and must support pagination.
# As there are no POST endpoints, have the necessary data pre-populated into the DB. 
# The GET endpoints are supposed to be protected. Implement OAuth2 and OIDC for the client to access these protected endpoints.
